# libclio
A lightweight c++ logging library.

From Greek mythology Clio is the muse of history, a very fitting name for a logging library.

# Building

You will need the following packages:
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf libtool

Then run the following to build:
$ autoreconf -vfi
$ ./configure
$ make

For cross compilation pass in your toolchain via HOST option:
$ autoreconf -vfi
$ ./configure --host=arm-linux-gnueabihf
$ make

# Documentation

For documentation you will need the following packages:
$ sudo apt-get install doxygen

If you want PDF/PS support install these packages too (its quite large):
$ sudo apt-get install texlive texlive-latex-extra

Then run the following to generate all doxygen documentation:
$ make doxygen-doc

If you only want HTML output instead run the following:
$ make doxygen-html
